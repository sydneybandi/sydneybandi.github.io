# Data Science Portfolio - Sydney Bandi
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. This portfolio also contains my Achievements, skills, and certificates. It is updated on the regular basis.

## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/sydneybandi/portfolio/blob/master/images/telecom.jpg"> **[ Data Pipelines with Prefect and Docker](https://github.com/sydneybandi/Data_Pipelines/tree/main/prefect-docker)**

In this project I have used Prefect to store the workflow code in GitHub and run the pipeline in a Docker container.

The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.

## Micro Projects
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
    - [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/sydneybandi/Statistical_Methods/blob/main/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : In this file, I have implemented simple genetic algorithm that finds out the list of numbers which equal to any specified number when summed together.
    - [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/sydneybandi/Statistical_Methods/blob/main/Bayesian%20Statistics.ipynb) : In this file, I explored how bayesian statistics works and how prior assumption reflects posterior probabilities using Gun control example. 
    - [Gaussian Mixture Model and Expectation Maximization](https://github.com/sydneybandi/Statistical_Methods/blob/main/GMM-EM.ipynb): In this file, I implemented Expectation Maximization algorithm to find out true distribution of one dimensional GMM of 2 gaussians.
    - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/sydneybandi/Statistical_Methods/blob/main/Linear%20Regression.ipynb): In this file, I aim to solve linear regression using analytical method and also by implementing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and minibatch gradient descent algorithms. 
    - [Neural Network Implementation](https://github.com/sydneybandi/Statistical_Methods/blob/main/NN%20Implementation.ipynb): In this file, I implemented simple neural network using forward propogation, backword propogation and optimization functions to predict the customer churn.
 
- ### Challenges
    - [SQL Challenges](https://github.com/sydneybandi/Challenges/tree/main/SQL): This repository contains codes of online SQL challenges (From Hackerrank, Leetcode, Testdome, etc.) solved by me.
    - [Data Science Challenges](https://github.com/sydneybandi/Challenges/tree/main/DS-Challenges): This repository contains codes of online Data Science challenges (From Hackerrank, TestDome, etc.) solved by me.
